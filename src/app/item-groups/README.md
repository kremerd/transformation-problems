# Item groups

## Situation

Assume a REST API provides the contents of a shopping cart as a list of items it contains.
For frontend display you want to group those items by product type (item id).
Conversely you'll have to convert such item groups back when sending data to the API.

## Things to learn

* Group elements of an array by property
* Expand an array by inserting duplicate elements

## Hints

* Use imperative programming style, i.e. `for .. of` loops. You might need more than one.
* To track groups you already created check out the ECMAScript `Map`.
